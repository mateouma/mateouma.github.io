			<h2>Music Haul 3/10</h2>
			<p>For some reason this year, I started listening to symphonies. I think it's a natural listening progression for classical musicians: short contained pieces for a singular instrument (ex. Chopin Nocturnes) -> larger pieces (ex. Chopin Ballades) -> concertos -> symphonies. I admit that they are very much an acquired taste - you need to have a decently long attention span and an ear for noticing and appreciating elements of quality orchestral music. I swear, I'm not pretentious. All jokes aside, I think listening to symphonies is a great exercise for putting yourself in another musician's shoes. The questions I think about most when listening to these are "what can I create with an army of 100-200 musicians," and "what must it be like to command them at the stage?" I think of these questions more with symphonies because 1) these were created in a time when streaming music, even via radio, was not yet conceptualized and 2) they must be performed in front of a large audience, demanding their full attention. Violin sonatas could be performed within the comfort of one's home amongst a small group of friends and family, but symphonies (and concertos) must be performed in a large concert setting in front of hundreds. The stakes are high. What's the point of gathering this many people if you can't awe them within the next hour or so? </p>
			
			<b><i>Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Op. 18</i> - Rachmaninoff</b><br>
			<i>Performed by Mao Fujita and the LA Phil led by Domingo Hindoyan</i>
			<p>Certified classic. One of the first piano concertos I ever listened to, and forever a favorite. Is there anything more to say about this piece?</p>
			
			<b><i>Symphony No. 5 in B-flat major, Op. 100</i> - Prokofiev</b><br>
			<i>Performed by the LA Phil led by Domingo Hindoyan</i>
			<p>Wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did. I didn't always have an ear for Prokofiev, but he's growing on me.</p>

			<b><i>Piano Concerto No. 3 in C major, Op. 26</i> - Prokofiev</b><br>
			<p>This piece feels like having a manic episode in C major. The high strings are the feelings of elation, and the piano runs are the continuous streams of energy. Again, wasn't super into Prokofiev, but I really like this piece. Highly recommend as an intro to his music.</p>

			<b><i>Symphony No. 5 in D minor, Op. 47</i> - Shostakovich</b><br>
			<p>I think I see a trend here. Russian music is just great. This symphony feels very militaristic and you can really hear the Soviet influence. Great use of trumpets.</p>

			<b><i>Symphony No. 6 in B minor, "Path√©tique"</i> - Tchaikovsky</b><br>
			<p>Absolute masterpiece. The melodies are gorgeous, the layering and texture is amazing, and the restraint is quite incredible. Less is more, but also more is more. <b>Highly recommend.</b></p>

			<b><i>Symphony No. 2 in C minor, "Resurrection"</i> - Mahler</b><br>
			<p>Another masterpiece. Never have I ever listened to a piece so grand and beautiful - I can only liken it to a religious experience. I was walking around campus and started weeping listening to the finale. That's all I'll say, <b>give it a listen.</b></p>
			
			<b><i>DAMN.</i> - Kendrick Lamar</b><br>
			<p>What a story. I briefly bought into the "different story in reverse" theory for this album, but I'm going to take what Kendrick said at face value and just enjoy the different feel of the album played back to front. I love the darker vibes, it (especially with the album cover) all feels so sinister and dark.</p>

			<b><i>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</i> - Kendrick Lamar</b><br>
			<p>More awesome storytelling. The production is also kinda insane, as with any Kendrick LP. The melodies are such ear worms, and day-to-day I can hear one of the songs randomly making its way into my head. Each song is a bop, which I can't say about <i>DAMN.</i></p>

			<b><i>The Queen is Dead</i> - The Smiths</b><br>
			<p>Groovy dude.</p>
