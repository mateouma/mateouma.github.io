My name is Mateo and I am currently a student in [Boston University's Computational Neuroscience Ph.D. program](https://www.bu.edu/neuro/academics/graduate/curriculum/computational-neuroscience-curriculum/). Prior to starting, I studied Statistics, Data Science, and Mathematical Biology at UCLA.

My research centers around neural computation in the cortex, specifically **how circuits in the most recently evolved part of the mammalian brain support cognition and behavior**. I am currently studying the contributions of neuronal cell-types to computation using techniques from electrophysiology, optics, statistical signal processing, and dynamical systems modeling. I fervently believe in the ability of science to improve lives and improve our understanding of the world, and I will always advocate for rigorous, accessible, and kind science. Outside of the lab, I can be found building brain-computer interfaces, performing classical/jazz piano, or reading a book! I'm from Pasadena, CA, and I currently reside in Boston, Massachusetts.
